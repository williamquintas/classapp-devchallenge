#**Welcome to CSV to JSON**
*author:* **William Quintas de Melo**

----------
This app uses Node, Express, and Formidable, allowing you to upload a csv file and gets this translated to JSON.

A live-demo is available on: [ClassApp Dev Challenge on Heroku](https://classapp-devchallenge.herokuapp.com/)


----------
Other modules used: validator, google-libphonenumber, path, ejs and fs.
In addition the Bootstrap was used to make the pages on front-end.

The main module was built by me: the `csv2json.js`
